# Hypatia

Hypatia is an experimental compiler for the experimental language named "Hypatia". It is an educational side project and can be used as an example on how compilers work. I hope it may benefit anyone who is also interested in how compilers operate.

## Installation
Funnily enough, one requires the g++ compiler to build this compiler from source. Please make sure you have both cmake and g++ installed. in your Hypatia folder, create a folder named 'build'. `cd` into the directory and run `cmake ..`. Now the make file should be generated in your build folder. Simply run `make` to build the compiler. 

## Hypatia syntax
The goal is for every `.hyp` file to follow sort of the same syntax as the `c` programming language. However some syntax might change. When the compiler is nearing the test phase there'll be a clear description of the code syntax of Hypatia.
